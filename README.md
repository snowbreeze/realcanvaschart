# Real Time HTML5 Canvas Chart

## What?
A simple lightweight line chart. Uses HTML5 Canvas to draw a line chart. 

## Why?
Add real time points to the chart using the add point function. This can be used when you have huge amount of incoming data that needs to be plotted constantly without reloading the entire chart.
Google charts and most other charts cant be refreshed with new data points at such high speeds. Use this in such situations.
